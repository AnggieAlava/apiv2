# Introduction

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or client. When a user attempts to access a system or application, they must provide credentials to prove their identity. This can include entering a username and password, presenting a digital certificate, or even providing biometric data like a fingerprint.

## Authorization

Authorization is the process that comes after authentication and it determines what permissions an authenticated user has within a system. This means defining what actions a user is allowed to perform, what resources they are allowed to access, and what operations they are able to execute.
