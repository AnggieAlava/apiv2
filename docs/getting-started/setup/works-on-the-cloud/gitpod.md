# Works on Gitpod

## What is Gitpod?

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) is a code editor on the cloud, It might be based on [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com), a free version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

### Disadvantages of using Gitpod

- Pylance is the better extension for python developers, actually the big companies hates compete, [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) injected a validation and you cannot install or execute Pylance (and other extensions made by them) on any editor that was not released by them, even if that editor is based in Visual Studio Code, so, you paid to use that extension with your soul, eventually should be a good idea change this extension with another one.
