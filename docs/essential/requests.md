# Requests

Requests is an HTTP library that only supports synchronous code, this is the most popular choice due to its API and is the oldest library (among [AIOHTTP](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/), [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) and [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/)).

## When use it

Celery does not have good support for [asyncronomous code](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)>), I do not know which option is better between Requests and [AIOHTTP](./aiohttp.md), I suggest you that you chose Requests until we have a study.
