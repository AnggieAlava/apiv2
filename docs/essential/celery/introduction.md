# Introduction

[Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/index.html) is a [asynchronous](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)>) [task queue](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)#task_queue>) which provided us a way to implement parallelism in 4geeks, usually it is used for execute operation which taken a long time, and it only support [Python](https://www.python.org).

## Historical use on 4geeks

The support for asynchronous execution was added from [Django](../django/introduction.md) 4, during a long time we used Django 3.12, and Celery helped us to deal with this purpose.
